When I approached the traffic constable there to help us to cross the road, he said it is not his duty. He was quite rude and asked me to report at the police assistant booth adjacent to the mall. When I approached them they asked me to go to nearby police station (which is new town police station , which is 10-12 km away from the venue) and put the compliant. I told him that the booth they are occupying says “POLICE ASSISTANCE BOOTH” why are they sending me to police station, they said they have nothing to do with what I am asking for.

(Specially I remember the day for the event of Kartik Puja & Chhat Puja together this year) Even I have proof & witnesses to justify my statement such as My mobile tower locations & access, Family Members & Others, even I don\'t & didn\'t allowed any one else to drive my vehicle ever & also on that day too as usual & I posses both the given keys with me & in safe custody always when unused & moreover my vehicle is equipped with anti lock system pre-installed which clearly states that it cannot be started without this two keys in this world except manufacturer makes any dublicate which is subject to my authorization, I along with my vehicle has never been to the mentioned place in my life & specially on the given date & time (which can be further scrutinized by means of CCTV installed in the surroundings & each exit points of that place of offence occurrence which recorded all events on road on that day more over Your Head Quarter also lies in that Locality as well as scrutinizing whole Kolkata\'s Installed CCTV would be more better).etc.\n\nNow understanding this issue I came to the following conclusions that after thinking all the possibilities for one whole day-\n\n1. Either there is any other vehicle/s using my number which is responsible for the offence which really is a nightmare for anyone facing it as well as me & really an important thing to worry about at present situations which is prevailing throughout the world.\n\n2. Or may be the person responsible for placing the case have serious distant visionary issues who cannot detect the difference between \'6111\' (perhaps) & \'6777\' because both  the numbers are illusive & non-identical which resembles more or less if seen from a certain distance during day or night for some one having distant vision-problem. As it is stated clearly that the vehicle was violating Pedestrial Line that means the vehicle was obeying the signal (if any) & obstructing the pedestrian\'s lane being static on the road which could have been stopped right at that place & could have been penalised with Spot Fine which clearly proves that the person placing the case was not near to the place of occurrence of the offence on the given particular day & time. Thats why he/she had to generate the case remotely or online in this manner due to distance or any other protocol/s obeyed if any.\n\n3. Or quote un quote there must be any Fresher/Newly recruited who was supposed to reach his/her Target given by the person\'s Senior on duty who anonymously imposed case against my Vehicle number illegally with out thinking of anything else.(I heard this kind of things often from General Public as well as some Police Officers too even possessing High Ranks & Posts in your Department. Although its a mystery to me & needs to be scrutinized further. Kindly don\'t take it as a obvious statement & I don\'t want to disclose or render anyone\'s name in this regard.\n\n4. Or I am lying completely.\n\n5. Or any other further reasons which may be unknown to me & needs to be detected yet.\n\nI as a citizen of India humbly request You & Your Department or any other responsible authorised personnel to look into the mater immediately with full concern & to resolve & conclude the raised issue with a fruitful result at an early date.\n\nI appeal to the core of your heart to response me [with an answer at least (which may be in my against)] but can satisfy my querry to the aforesaid Contact Details.\n\n***As its second time I have been sent a letter from your Department despite of My or My Vehicle\'s involvement in any Offence Violating any Law.\n\n(I paid the Previous Fine of Rs. 100/= as suggested by An O.C. previously whom I personally know & I discussed the mater with him for the \nCase no.- ooTW006032/15 \nDated - 16-01-2015 \nTime - 19-21 \nPlace - In front of Gems Cinema on A.J.C.

Perhaps You too will co-operate us solving every problem in future too.\n\nMY KIND SUGGESTION : \n\n1. Install High Definition Automated CCTV Programable Cameras at proper places with intervals which can record any event occured in any where which can accompany the case letters with evidences too.As Used in Bangaluru,Delhi & many other places in the world.\n\n2. Recommend A Unique Electromagnetic Identifying Device at Signals or Crossings as well as Identifiers to each Registered Vehicle (Old/New) or (Free GPS Networks & Devices in Vehicles or in the Driver\'s/Owner\'s or Authorised Driver\'s Smart Phone with a unique password to connect travelling in a particular vehicle which should be mandatory to keep on while driving & to show to authorised persons if asked in any place along with other documents) which can state the Presence & Position of any vehicle at any given time & date in the country.\n\nMy earnest request kindly take this issue as a friend not as a Police Personal so that in future you can eradicate any Public Harasment & also spending your valuable time reading this kind of issues as stated by me with due respect to your department & all in person.

(which was clearly told to the taxi driver). As we took a turn from Kyd Str. into Chowringhee lane he refused to go to Sudder Str. and turned the taxi towards Marquis Str. saying that you have to get down here (even though traffic rules allow us to go straight) to which we refused because I am a senior citizen, aged 65 years and having severe body pain. Post-this, he started abusing us and threatening us. Once even physically touching me, to intimidate us. His behaviour and body language, were frankly too abusive to be described. As passerby\'s came to our help, we could reach our destination albeit with extra cost. His overall attitude, temperament, and body language smacked that of a street-side rogue. Unless action is taken against such drivers they will continue to harass people who appear weak, vulnerable and unable to provide resistance. \nWe also noticed that he has erased his taxi number which is supposed to be displayed inside the taxi. We are attaching a couple of photos for your reference and as evidence. Please take appropriate action and let us know how we can follow-up with the department to ensure that action is taken against him. \n\nRegards,\nArvind Kumar Mehta\n\nPS: Please note that we have also lodged a complaint via your online portal.

To my horror, i kept waiting there for 2 hours and despite calling the guard post several times there was no sign of the KIND and HELPFUL officer. With an injured leg, I kept hopping from one traffic guard to the other in despair. Finally, was shown some mercy and after more than 2 hours, a person in civil dress came and unclamped my bike. On asking him on who finally sent him, he did not have any answer and left in a hurry.

('129115403803409_10153851779799097', 'Long post, but it would be a good read, trust me.\n\nOn my way to the GD Birla Sabhaghar on 02.05.15 evening, to watch the Play \'Ek Mulaqat\', I observed that an old lady of around 65, was lying on the pavement, close to the Tiru Mani main Gate, Ballygunge phari. I observed that people like me looked at her & passed by, but no one helped her in any way.\n\nSince the play was about to start I rushed in & tried in vain to contact \'Nirmal Hriday\' a home of Missionaries Of Charity, at Kalighat, but had issues with net connectivity & hence could not call them.\n\nOn my way back, I did not find the old lady at that place & thought that she might have left, only to see her lying close to \'The Dhaba\' & she did not seem well at all. Seemed she had not had anything to eat & was extremely frail.\n\nThis time I was lucky with the net connection & got through to Nirmal Hriday. Explained the matter to a Sister who said that I needed to bring the matter immediately to the notice of Kolkata Police (KP) , because with out proper cop documents they do not admit any inmate into their home, at Kalighat.\n\nI immediately rushed to the Traffic Sargent at the phari crossing & urged him to look into the matter by getting some much needed help \'cause I felt that the lady may not survive through the night in the absence of any medical help.\n\nThe Sargent, Golok Sarkar immediately informed Gariahat PS, his base PS, and since the Dhaba area came under Ballygunge PS, asked a colleague at Gariahat PS to inform his counterpart at Ballygunge PS to send some help immediately. All this while he was attending to his job of registering cases of traffic violators etc....After a wait of about half an hour SI, Mr. AK Laha of Ballygunge PS, came with his colleague on an Enfield Bullet, and immediately attended to the Old lady.\n\nI was amazed at the sincerity of Mr. Laha who spoke to the elderly lady, as if she was his Mother, poured water on her head, made her sit up against a wall, offered her ORS & arranged for Tea for her. Inquired about her family, home & other members etc....Thanked me for being a responsible citizen & decided to take the Lady to Ballygunge PS, as it was almost 2100 hrs. I took Mr. Laha\'s no. and got to know of his plans for her medical treatment as well.\n\nThe reason I decided to share this with all of you, is that, often such acts of promptness by the police do not get registered or talked about, in the public domain, and they do not get credit for the difficult job that they are expected to do in the Kolkata heat, day after day, without much recognition.\n\nI therefore decided to document this event, which is special for me, as an experience and would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank, Sargent. Golok Sarkar of Gariahat PS & SI AK Laha of Ballygunge PS for doing the needful & helping the distraught Lady.\n\nFolks we always expect the police to do their job, come what may, but if we too can lend a helping hand by bringing matters to their notice promptly, chances are, it would lead to a much harmonious relationship between the citizens & the police.\n\nThank you, KP. Indeed very proud of you.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Kolkata-Police/132989860074312\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/KolkataTrafficPolice?fref=ts\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/search/132989860074312/likers\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/search/120083111372008/likers', '2015-05-05T04:05:26+0000', 'positive'),

Re-sharing as I cannot help appreciating it over n over again.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nYesterday, around 2 am, after attending a Marriage reception ceremony in Dunlop area, Me and my two friends Shubhradip and Aritra were returning to Garia to drop Shubhradip and then return back home . After hitting a pothole in BT Road we started hearing strange noises from the left side of the car, unsure of the problem we kept going as the area we were crossing was unsafe at night . just when we were in the middle of The \"Maa\" flyover the left Mudguard broke apart with loud noise and we figured out that the upper chunk of the tubeless tyre gave away, and the rest could posses serious trouble if we keep going.  somehow managed to drive the car at a very low pace with the risk of getting hit from behind on the blind corners of the flyover. Once we came down, much to our astonishment the spare tire did not have any air. We were stuck near east calcutta township on EM BYPASS for the night we realized.  tried contacting all the maruti authorized dealers and discovered everything was closed at it was around 3 o clock. On the verge of giving up after asking many cab drivers that none of the tire or servicing shops will be open, one of us discovered a police booth. After approaching with our problem, one Police person took one of my friends at the backseat of his bike and asked us to follow ! he went to a mechanics place beside the road, woke him up and requested to help us . that guy was not ready for this kind of problem and started asking very high amounts , the police personnel even helped us with that . He said, and I quote \" Beshi kichu lagle ami diye dicchi, tui eder ke thik kore de, rat e osubidhey poreche\"\n\nWe stood there with pure awe while these things took place infront of our eyes , A police officer helping us firstly showing us the place where we could fix the Tire , getting involved in the matter and making the mechanic understand the problem which includes bargaining after waking him up at midnight and making him fix that , not for once we heard any arrogance in his voice. A very polite helping-hand which rescued us at midnight . This is what Kolkata is known for. We felt safe even at 3 am where cars were speeding past an empty road near Patuli Township. He took care of us like we were known to him for years. \n\nOfficer Kamal Das and ASI Adhir Kr. Roy of Tiljala Police station , I salute you !

After a long lunch celebrating an otherwise happy occasion, our mood was instantly quelled by a brilliant show by Kolkata\'s \"Finest\".\nThey slapped illegal parking tickets on our cars even after a parking attendant helped park our cars. The mentioned attendant was nowhere to be found when we were about to leave, and were replaced by a bevy of police officers giving us tickets. The officers refused to answer any of our queries and refused to wait for the parking attendant to return. We looked for the parking attendant, who was conveniently in absentia by then. \nObviously enraged, we protested,  and the police officers, who apparently are in charge of our safety and overall wellbeing, started to play nasty. One officer screamed insults and reproves at one of us, while another officer went so far as to open his jacket, preparing to get into a physical brawl, shouting threats. \nEventually, as it always happens In India, the system won over logic and reasoning, and obvious lack of a mandatory No Parking sign. Not only did we get case tickets,  we were also the lucky recipients of an obviously errant officer catching someone by the scruff of his neck and another one of us (a girl,  no less) roughly on the arm, vowing to \"leave you with a scar\".\n\n\nThis lane is a popular hangout zone for the young generation and we urge anyone else who faced what we did today to share their experiences.  This is the only way to create awareness and let people know that the so-called law enforcement officials are being consumed by corruption and greed, a little more everyday.\nWe don\'t know what exactly is going on, but it seems ridiculous that a parking attendant is assisting a whole line of cars to park, and conveniently disappears suddenly,  only to be replaced by an army of \"righteous\" police officers.', '2015-01-10T12:01:52+0000', 'positive'),

While he was waiting at the traffic signal a Maruti Alto car bearing No WB16AK 7805 rammed into his stationary car at a great speed. The suddenness of the incident caused him a neck sprain and damaged the car. Thankfully he was saved from any physical injury. The police sergeant attending to his duties nearby arrived at the scene immediately but strangely was of the opinion that such an issue be sorted between the reckless driver and the victim , in this case my husband.He did not even ask for the licence of the reckless driver leave alone impose any fine or impound his licence. The errant driver fleed the spot and my husband proceeded to lodge a complaint with Tiljala PS and put the damaged car into the workshop.\nMy concerns are\n1. When traffic policemen slap fines for even very minor lapses on the part of drivers how could a reckless driver causing considerable damage to a vehicle be just let off?\n2. Why was the driver not even asked to show his licence? What if he is not even eligible to drive.\n3. Why do we always have to wait for something fatal to happen until we take a step against rash drivers who ram into a stationary vehicle?\n4. When violating a signal, parking on the road (even when a No parking sign is absent) are treated as offences, on what grounds are reckless drivers let off?\nJust to add the police officials at Tiljala PS have been very cordial and helpful according to my husband but I as a wife, mother and a woman who drives her own car would request Kolkata Traffic Police to be much more proactive in their role in booking drivers who cause accidents which can no way be ignored as minor mistakes. The passive role of the traffic sergeant in this case added as a boost for the errant driver who might cause many more such casualties and who knows one might just turn fatal.\nAttaching herewith the pic of the car which caused damage to my husband\'s car(obviously the front portion of the car got damaged too).\nPlease do give us some hope.', '2015-08-20T17:54:41+0000', 'negative'),

Suddenly one swift silver colour (wb 06g 4630) came behind me and went thourgh me and the car at very high speed and was signalling something at me in anger  may be because he was disturbed my my slow speed. As you know road works are in progress and it is a bit tough for a bike to go at high speed because of the uneven surface on the flyover and there is speed limit.\n\nNow i crossed the flyover and he was waiting at the 7 point crossing signal. I asked him why he was driving like this which may lead to a big issue. His response was like why i was going slow and if i was goimg slow why i was not going at the most left side. He was very angry and was using abusing languages using the worst words one can say. I stood in front of him for a discussion in presense of the police official there. Police came and asked the issue. I told him then he asked both me and that driver to go to side and discuss. I was going to park my bike at the side. The  signal got green and the car went from there. And i also came towards my home.\n\nNow i have a question. When there is speed limit how can a car drive dangeroualy on a flyover where there has been many accidents in past and also when the road works are in progress.

My car was parked behind a car that was already parked usually the stretch where cars are parked on sunday ! I had parked it on sunday for my 10 minutes work at jaggubazar. \nWhen i came back i saw the clamp on my tyre .\nI was astonished to know the stretch where my car was parked was a no parking zone and having known that i went upto the cop sitting inside the crane standing next to our car. I and another man whose car was clamped  requested for spot fine. The COP agreed to it and charged a sum of Rs 300/- (Rs 100 for Kolkata police , Govt of West Bengal Dept fund challan No 350973and Rs 200 for challan in the name of Saini crane lifters challan number 3899 ) \nAfter paying there i saw there were 2 cars with Govt of West Bengal stickers also parked in the NO parking zone same as mine . \nI asked the cop to charge those cars with fine as well and i stood there to assure it happens.

I demanded to know his name and took his photograph . As he knew he was wrong he got abusive  to my female friend who was also trying to click the picture and said \" F*** Off\" .

Many of the other passengers also tried to request them to take them to their destination within Kolkata, yet they were not willing to go anywhere. Many female passengers were also present, who were also trying to avail their service, yet they were equally harsh with them.\nWhen I warned them that I will take their photos and will post while complaining on the Kolkata Traffic Police website, they said that such websites do not actually exist because no action has ever been taken against them from there. Many passengers, like me, had earlier warned about complaining in your website, but no action has ever been taken against them.\nThe local Tea stall owners and other residents had also informed us that these taxi drivers are very Rogue and misbehave not only with the passengers but also with all the local residents. They only ferry passengers who are willing to pay them heavy extras, especially while going to the DumDum Airport.\nI have taken the photographs.

And none of the trips i have gone to the area mentioned in the case. \n\nI went to my office in the morning from my home (See image Trip 1). I went to my another office  (See image Trip 2). I returned to my home (See image Trip 3).\n\nMoreover my Car Engine was stopped at 13:53 Hrs at Metropolitan Location after coming from  my office (Trip 2) And again the engine was started at 18:37 Hrs. While returning home (Trip 3). \n\nAs with the above data we can see I have not travelled to the said location. Nor my vehicle engine was on at that time.\n\nIt is thus evident that the case is wrongly updated against my Car, thus request you to withdraw this case and rectify the records and your fine in the website https://kolkatatrafficpolice.net/CaseDetails_Multiple_Payment.aspx\n\nThanking you in anticipation\nJOY MOJUMDER \nMobile 9433302323', '2017-04-18T10:09:03+0000', 'neutral'),

As i was not carrying that much of cash with me at that point of time, he told me that he will settle the matter in 2000 rupees..where i didnt entartained him and told him to take necessary legal action against me. in which he seized my DL and gave me this slip instead.\nthere were two traffic surgeons. \njust infront of me , there was an offender whodrove from the no entry side.\nhe was not issued any chalan and instead was let scott free for an exchange of 250 rs.\n\nmy question is, is this how the system works?\nwith bribe and false charges?\n\ntoday i went to the court in order to release my seized documents, when i came to know that i need to pay 1400 for lapsed insurance and 600 for air pollution.\nthe question is how come a PUBLIC SERVANT give us wrong info about the penalty charges? \nthis is absolutely ridiculous. demanding double the actual amount?\nwhat a shame. \nplease teach these dishonest police officers not to misuse their power.

They cannot do anything about it . \n\n2. The stop lines are drawn far off from the crossing sometimes as much as 10-15 mtrs from the crossing . Classic example is the stop line drawn at Siemens crossing for traffic flowing towards Ruby (10-15 mtrs) from the Siemens crossing . In this case what will we do if we cross the stop sign and light turns red . If car stops u give stop line violation . I car speeds away you give crossing signal in red light violation . \n\nWould request your kind comments in this matter .

THANKS GREAT PRINCE MICHAEL!\n\nI am about to approach a very serious, dangerous, controversial subject in Islam religion and the world which might bring me a lot of trouble but I feel the need to address it for justice equality and freedom and healing to the worlds. I do not condone homesexuality, lesbianism, or bisexuality as a man of Almighty god Allah and a servant of God and Christ and am a heterosexual and a lover of all Woman and heterosexual relations. But I understand through past relationships how circumstances can alter the glory of a god in humanity and mankind to practices that are not approved of by Allah, the religion Islam and other faiths to do what is contrary to natural law and what is right in the eyesight of god his prophets words religion and revelation. We say homesexuality lesbianism dikeism and bisexuality is wrong according to the word of god and punishable by death or servere punishment but have we considered some circumstances that cause it contrary to Allah god and Christ. I don\'t think no soul that comes into the world wants to choose to be an enemy of Allah god and Christ by being this way and intentenally want to earn the wrath of god of Almighty god Allah. There are some who have been raped molested or sexually abused and tampered with by their fathers mothers brothers sisters uncle aunts mentors and friends that have made them that way. Should not Islam and the religions of the world offer them a medicine healing help and support to heal them of their condition rather than codemn them or kill them since they had no control of their circumstances. If the holy Quran and bible and Islam a cure for all ills and a mercy for all humanity and mankind. Should those who have been victims and made others than themselves be put to death cast out for circumstance out there control and denied the mercy and medicine of Allah god Christ and Muhammad and salvation. I personally don\'t think so I\'m do the salvation of the whole. As salaam alaikum amin\n\nLike\nComment\nSeen by 10\nShareefa M Carrion\nAs salam alaikum Peter Palmer. And your point of this post is what? Ramadan is about to start and in my humble opinion this is NOT the subject that should be addressed nor discussed. We should concentrate on gaining a closer relationship with Allah. Personally I can care less about a persons sexual orientation. I am not perfect and I have better things to do than wonder about another persons desire or life style. No one is perfect and we ALL have work to do in regards to our Deen and where we stand in the eyes of Allah. Right now, today, this is not the time nor place to discuss this issue. All this topic will do is cause division. And I am all about uniting the ummah. Ok pls stay away from This topic.

I\' m addressing an issue that needs medicine and healing but just because myself and you were protected from this abuse or not rape molestation sexual assalt or abuse doesn\'t mean that we should cast out those who have been abused and alter from the healing of Ramadan the holy Quran Islam and the bible. It is the sick and the sin sick soul that needs salvation rather than the preserved saved and righteous. To whom much is goven much is required. We should want for our brothers and sisters what we want and benefit ourselves.

LET THIS MIND BE IN US THATS IN CHRIST JESUS, BE IN THE WORLD NOT OF IT THIS IS THE TRUE SEPARATION THAT GIVES US THE ABILITY TO TRANSFORM THE WORLD AND MAKE THIS KINGDOM THE KINGDOM OF OUR GOD AND CHRIST, WHEN JESUS DESCENDED INTO HELL TO GET THE KEYS TO HEAVEN WITHOUT BEING CONSUMED BY THE EVIL THERE IN HE WAS SEPERATE FROM THEM WHICH WAS CONTRARY TO HIS LIFE AND MISSION BUT WAS ONE WITH WHAT WAS ETERNAL AND FOR SALVATION IN AN OPPOSITE REALITY. THIS IS HOW ALLAH BECOMES OMNIPRESENT AND WHATS EVER IS IN THE HEAVENS AND EARTH BECOME HIS. OMNIPRESENT IN EVERY PLACE THAT EXIST YET NOT PLAQUE BY THE IMPERFECTION OR EVIL THERE IN. LIKE THE NIGHT AND DAY THEY ARE SEPARATE YET ONE.THE MESSENGER OF ALLAH SAID THAT HEAVEN AND HELL WAS A STATE OF MIND YOU GET TO BOTH PLACES BY THE THOUGHTS AND PRACTICES.TRUE SEPARATION IS THE CIRCUMSION OF THE HEART THE RENEWAL OF THE MIND. MUHAMMAD DID\'NT SEPARATE PHYSICALLY TO TRANSFORM ARABIA HIS HEART MIND AND SOUL AND OBEDIENCE TO THE REVELATION SEPARATED FROM THE MIND OF POLYTHIESM AND INCORRECT WAY OF THE QURAISH AND HE TRANSFORMED MECCA AND MEDINA AND ARABIA IN THE MIST OF OPPOSITION. THE EXAMPLE THAT THE QURAISH WAS IN THE HOLY CITY YET IN ERROR AND THE JEWS IN JERUSALEM YET IN ERROR PHARAOH IN EGYPT YET IN ERROR LUCIFER/IBLISS IN HEAVEN YET IN ERROR SHOWS THAT YOU CAN BE IN THE HOLIEST OF PLACES YET BE IN HELL OR WRONG STAE OF MIND WHICH LEADS NOT TO ELEVATION BUT DEGENERATION. THE BIBLE SAYS THIS KINGDOM IS TO BECOME THE KINGDOM OF OUR GOD AND CHRIST SO AS MUHAMMAD TRANSFORM MECCA AND ARABIA SO SHALL WE ARE CHARGED TO DO THE SAME BY ESTABLISHING THE KINGDOM OF GOD IN OUR SELVES WITH THE RENEWAL OF OUR MIND. THERE NO WHERE WE CAN RUN TO OR GO FOR REFUGE ECEPT TO ALLAH AND THE GOD OF SELF AND AS SERVANTS BE USED AS TOOL TO ESTABLISH GOD\'S DECREE IN THE HEART MIND AND SOULS OF HUMANITY AND MANKIND NOT BY MIGHT NOR BY FORCE BUT BY HIS SPIRIT SAITH THE LORD, THIS IS THE TRUE SEPARATION THE TRUE EXODUS AND THE TRUE VICTORY AND GOAL FOR THE SALVATION REDEMPTION ATONEMENT AND RECONCILIATION OF ALL THAT EXIST AND ITS TRANSFORMATION INTO THE GLORIES OF ALLAH GOD OR WHAT ALLAH GOD WANTS, NEW CREATURES IN ALLAH GOD AND CHRIST(MUHAMMAD). FOR THE BIBLE SAYS THAT MAN AND WOMAN ARE THE GLORY OF ALLAH GOD, AND THE HOLY QURAN SAYS THAT ALLAH GLORIFIES HIMSELF IN HIS CREATION.\n\nTHIS IS A DEDICATION TO THE MOST TAKEN FOR GRANTED DIVINE CREATION IN THE WORLD! THE FEMALE, OUR BLACK AND RED SISTERS AND ALL WOMAN OF ALL WALKS OF LIFE THE MERCY OF MAN AND MANKIND. CO CREATOR AND SACRED CARRIER OF LIFE! I LOVE YOU STAY STRONG BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE APPRECIATED IN ALL FORMS AND HUE AND COLORS!\n\nWOMAN ARE THE MOST PRECIOUS JEWEL ALLAH HAS GRANTED US OUT OF HIS MERCY AND BOUNTY NEXT TO HIMSELF AND CHRIST! BROTHERS LETS TAKE CARE OF THESE PRECIOUS VALUABLES, FOR IF YOU DON\'T TAKE CARE OF THESE PEARLS SOMEONE ELSE WILL SEE THEIR VALUE AND TAKE YOUR VALUABLE LADY AWAY! REMEMBER MAN IS THE MAINTAINER OF WOMAN, THEIRS NO SUCH THING AS FREE LOVE, WHEN A MAN FINDS A WIFE HE FINDS A GOOD THING, AND MARRIAGES HALF YOUR FAITH. HEAVEN LIES AT THE FOOT OF THE WOMAN, A NATION CAN RISE NO HIGHER THAN ITS WOMAN. WHEN YOU CIVILIZE A MAN YOU CIVILIZE AN INDIVIDUAL, WHEN YOU CIVILIZE A WOMAN YOU CIVILIZE A NATION AND SECURE YOUR FUTURE. 75 % OF THE DIVINE WORK OF SALVATION IS WITH THE WOMAN. SHE\'S YOUR FIRST TEACHER. REVERENCE HER AND REVERENCE HER WOMB FOR IT IS THE CREATIVE WORKSHOP THAT GOD PROCREATES AND CO-CREATES WITH HER TO SUSTAIN US AND OUR FUTURE. RESPECT HER AND SHE\'LL LOVE YOU AND GIVE YOU PARADISE WHILE YOU LIVE ON EARTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nTHE WORLD IS SO UNWORTHY OF WOMAN, THE PATRIACH SYSTEM HAS FAILED AND THE EGO OF MAN HAS CAUSED HIM TO ABUSE HIS MOTHER, DAUGHTER, FREIND, LOVER, AND COMFORTER WHICH IS WOMAN. HIS IGNORANCE HAS TURNED HIS HEAVEN THE FEMALE INTO HIS HELL AND DEMISE. HE HAS A CONSEQUENCE FOR THE MISUSE OF HER AND WE CAN SEE IT IN HIS PRODGENY. THE ONLY WAY TO RECOVER AND REDEEM FOR THIS SIN IS TO GO TO GOD FOR THE WISDOM TO KNOW AND HANDLE HIS MOST PRECIOUS AND COMPLICATED CREATION WHICH IS WOMAN.SHE IS THE ANSWER TO THE PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD. EDUCATE, LIBERATE HER, AND YOU SAVE YOURSELF AND YOUR FUTURE. SHE IS FIRST TEACHER AND SALVATION AND MERCY ARE AT HER FEET, ELEVATE LOVE AND RESPECT HER AND SHE\'LL BE A LOYAL COMPANION FOR LIFE, KEEP DISRESPECTING AND ABUSING HER AND SHE\'LL BE THE END OF YOU, YOUR EVOLUTION, GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT, FUTURE, AND YOUR LIFE!\n\nWoman are the greatest creation next to god almighty himself. The only reason she is not greater is because he god made her and all that is beautiful in her.\nWe are to be grateful for every opportunity god has given us his gift which is our divine life and be a blessing not a curse.\nGod is love and if we are from him then service and love should be in our everyday expression and practice.\n\nELEVATE AND PROTECT THE WOMAN a broken flower, a chipped diamond in the ruff, a fallen woman who’s got it very tough.\nA down trodden soul by the evil overseer an ignorant and corrupt man.\nA flower turned sour in mans corrupt hand.\nElevate and Protect the Woman brothers the corruption of the female is leading us to hell. Our children trapped in our ignorance and our future engaged in our twisted cell.\nElevate and Protect the Woman and save us all that\nwe all may escape hell.\nElevate and Protect the Woman and raise her to Allah’s\n(God’s) exalted place; respect and reverance the woman that we may save face; for she can give birth to God and bring you to Allah (God) face to face.\nA poem inspired by the Messenger of Allah Rasulallah Elijah Muhammad that I wrote. By Peter A Palmer/Aljabril/gabriel.\n\nI DEDICATE THIS REVELATION TO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN I HAVE EVER SEEN OR EXPERIENCED IN THE WORLD. RASULALLAH KAREEM MOST HONORABLE ELIJAH MUHAMMAD SAID THAT THEIR IS NO SUCH THING AS A NO GOOD WOMAN UNLESS A NO GOOD MAN MADE HER THAT WAY. HEAVEN LIES AT THE FOOT OF THE WOMAN. I CAN TESTIFY THATS THE TRUTH BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER HAD A NO GOOD WOMAN THANKS TO ALMIGHTY GOD ALLAH, AND THAT WOMAN HAVE BEEN A PILLAR OF STRENGTH TO ME AND AN INSPIRATION. SO I DEDICATE THESE POST TO THOSE IN MY MIND THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD INTERNALLY AS WELL AS EXTERNALLY. THE MOST BEAUTIFUL IMAGES I HAVE EVER LAID MY EYES AND HEART UPON, I WANT THE WORLD TO KNOW AND THEM TO KNOW THATS WHY I POST THIS SO THEY KNOW THAT I APPRECIATE, RESPECT, REVERANCE, AND ADORE THEM.\n\nALL WOMAN I WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE ALL BEAUTIFUL AND HOLY, COVERED AND UNCOVERED, SACRED OR PROSTUTALIZED OR EXPLOITED! REMEMBER A NATION CAN RISE NO HIGHER THAN ITS WOMAN. THE BEST OF WOMAN IS THE ONE WHO KNOWS HER DIVINITY AND DRESS MODEST AND COVERS HER SELF. SHE SHOWS SHE IS KNOWLEDGABLE OF HER DIVINE PLACE WITH ALMIGHTY GOD ALLAH. SHE\'S NOT BETTER THAN HER SISTER WHO EXPOSES HER DIVINE BEAUTY, SHE JUST A MERCY TO US MEN WHO ACT ON THE LEVEL OF DOGS AND FORGOT WHERE WE CAME FROM AND THROUGH, AS WELL AS WHERE CHRIST CAME THROUGH AND FROM. CHRIST AS WELL AS ALMAIN NABI MUHAMMAD (PBUH) CAME THROUGH AND FROM WOMAN.\n\nTHE REASON THEY ARE THE BEST AND NOT BETTER IS BECAUSE THEY FOLLOW THE WORD OF GOD FROM THE BIBLE AND THE QURAN AND ARE CLOSER TO THE STRAIGHT PATH! BUT RATHER YOU ARE CLOTHED IN YOUR MAJESTIC BIRTHDAY SUIT THE DIVINE FLESH THAT GOD MADE AND HIS SPIRIT AND SOUL OR IN THE HOLY GARMENTS MADE BY THE HANDS OF MAN, IF YOU DON\'T KNOW YOUR PLACE AS CO- CREATOR OR MOTHER OF CIVILIZATION THAN THE FUTURE IS LOST AND THE WORLD WON\'T BE SAVED. FOR WE MEASURE CIVILIZATION BY YOU BEAUTIFUL QUEEN AND MOTHER GODDESS OF ALL HUE AND COLORS. WE CANNOT BRING ABOUT A CHANGE TO CHANGE THE FUTURE UNTIL YOU ARE BROUGHT INTO DIVINE CONSCIOUSNESS SO YOU CAN TAKE YOUR RIGHTFUL PLACE AS MOTHER OF GOD, EARTH MOTHER, COSMIC MOTHER, OR MOTHER OF CIVILIZATION! ALL IS LOST IF WE DO\'NT ELEVATE YOU AND SO IS THE FUTURE! FOR THE MESSENGER OF ALLAH ELIJAH MUHAMMAD SAID THAT WHEN YOU TEACH AND CIVILIZE A MAN YOU TEACH AN INDIVIDUAL BUT WHEN YOU TEACH AND CIVILIZE A WOMAN YOU TEACH A NATION AND SECURE THE SALVATION OF THE FUTURE! THIS WORLD IS HELL FOR YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN IF YOU DON\'T KNOW YOURSELF FOR HEAVEN LIES AT THE FOOT OF THE WOMAN AND YOUR SACRED WOMB LIES ABOVE THOSE DIVINE FEET AND WITH THE RIGHT KNOWLEDGE IN YOUR HEAD YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT IS WORTHY OF YOUR TIME, ENERGY AND WOMB AND WHO IS WORTHY TO EXPERIENCE THAT SACRED PLACE TO PRODUCE THE FRUITS OF GOD FOR THE SALVATION OF THE NATIONS AND HUMANITY AND MANKIND!\n\nTHAT\'S WHY THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION IS SO IMPORTANT IT SHOWS WHAT YOU CAN PRODUCE IF GOD IMPREGNATES THE WOMB OF YOUR MIND WITH THE WORD OF GOD AND THE AGENCY OF THE HOLY SPIRIT THE FRUIT OF GOD WITHOUT THE INTERFERENCE OF FALLEN MAN. YOUR WOMB CAN PRODUCE CHILDREN OF DESTINY LIKE HOLY MOTHER MARYAM THE MOTHER OF JESUS CHRIST THE SAVIOR AND THE ARABIAN PRINCESS AMINAH THE MOTHER OF LORD ALAMIN NABI MUHAMMAD (PBUH) THE SAVIORS OF HUMANITY AND MANKIND! IN THE IDEAL LIFE WHEN MAN IS RESSURECTED AND COME TO KNOW WHO AND WHAT YOU ARE AND LOVE AND RESPECT WOMAN AS HOLY MOTHER MARYAM IS LOVED AND RESPECTED, THE MOTHER OF CHRIST, THEY WILL THEN KNOW HOW TO RESPECT THEIR MOTHERS, DAUGHTERS AND GRANDMOTHERS AND OTHERS THEN IT WON\'T MATTER WHAT YOU WEAR BUT UNTIL THEN DRESSING MODEST IT IS A PROTECTION FOR YOURSELF!

THIS IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN TAUGHT BY THE MOST HONORABLE MINISTER LOUIS FARRAKHAN THE DIVINE MERCY OF OUR MESSENGER ELIJAH MUHAMMAD HERE IN THE WILDERNESS OF NORTH AMERICA BY THE GRACE AND MERCY OF CHRIST MICHAEL ANTHONY (AL HAD/ECHAD) MASTER FARD MUHAMMAD IN PERSON THE PROMISED SON OF MAN IMAM AL MAHDI OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOR HAZRAT ISA IBN MARYAM LORD JESUS THE CHRIST IMAM AL MASI (THE MESSIAH) THE PROMISE OF LORD ALAMIN NABI MUHAMMAD NABIULLAH AKMED (PBUH).\"...…..\n\nLA ILAH HA IL ALLAH WADAHU WAHDAHU WAHDAH!\nTHERE IS NO GOD EXCEPT ALLAH, THE ONE AND ONLY ONE!..........\n\nLA ILAH HA LAH ALLAH! MUHAMMAD DAN RASULALLAH!\nALLAH U AKBAR! THANKS GREAT PRINCE MICHAEL!\n\nMUHAMMAD IS THE MESSENGER OF ALLAH AND JESUS IS THE MESSIAH!\n\nLove overcomes hate. Truth overcomes falsehood. Light overcomes spiritual darkness. God overcomes satan. Christ overcomes the world.\nGod is love. Al wadud, agape, philos, eros. Love cast out fear. Love covers a multitude of sin. God is love. Love is perfection.\nLove covers a multitude of sins! JESUS SAYS \"Love ALLAH GOD with all your heart, mind, and soul, want for your brother what you want for yourself, do unto others as i have done unto you and love ye one another as i have loved you\"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nMUHAMMAD SAYS \" We pass from death into LIFE when we love the brother and sisterhood!\"\n\nFor those who have malice in their heart do to ignorance for Muhammad and Islam! Muhammad was an extension of the holy spirit as taught by ruh alamin, the archangel gabriel, who is the angel of the divine presence, servant of god, hero of god, mighty man of god do your research before you speak such evil lies about the holy prophet. may allah forgive you and bless you with the light of understanding not hate and disrespect of the sacred!\n\nMuhammad was a messenger and and extension of gods grace and mercy after the church and the gospel fell in the hands of the pope and Christianity and the true Essenes of the gospel and Jesus was lost. He was given the holy Quran and the tenants of faith which is called Islam to bring humanity and mankind back to the straight path. Salvation in Islam is accept seek entire submission of self and life to almighty god Allah his messenger(s) prayer charity spiritual warfare which is exstablishing god and the divine in self and others through service and sacred pilgrimage which is the journey of the essence to the sacred and immortal part of mans heart body mind and soul in it\'s highest developement or evolution to became one with god the sacred and the holy. Muhammad said we past from death into life when we love the brother and sister of the ummah humanity and mankind\n\nLA ILAH HA IL ALLAH WADAHU WAHDAHU WAHDAH!\nTHERE IS NO GOD EXCEPT ALLAH, THE ONE AND ONLY ONE!\n\nLA ILAH HA LAH ALLAH! MUHAMMAD DAN RASULALLAH!\nALLAH U AKBAR! THANKS GREAT PRINCE MICHAEL!\n\nTHE SWORD IS CALLED THE WORD OF GOD IN THE HOLY BIBLE, IT SAYS THE WORD OF GOD (THE TRUTH) CUTS LIKE A TWO EDGE SWORD, THE TRUTH PIERCES THE MIND OF THE IGNORANT ALLOWS HIM THE POWER TO PROTECT HIM OR HERSELF AND BE JUSTIFIED TO BE A CHILD OF GOD THROUGH THE ENLIGHTENMENT OF THE WORD OF GOD. WHEN MEN OF POWER USE THIS LANGUAGE IT IS EXPRESIONS OF DEFENDING THE FAITH. THROUGH WORDS AND SYMBOLS PARABLES LIKE THE SHRINERS SWORD, THE CHRISTIAN SWORD, ALSO THE MUSLIMS SWORD. SOMETIMES THIS SYMBOL IS TAKEN LITERALLY AND THE TRUTH BECOME DISTORTED AND PEOPLE ARE HARMED BY THE VERY INSTRUMENT MEANT TO PROTECT, UPLIFT, RESURRECT, JUSTIFY AND SAVE THEM!\nTHERE HAVE BEEN MANY VIOLENT ACTS WHICH WERE UNJUST AND UNFAIR CARRIED OUT IN THE NAME OF GOD BY ALL RELIGIONS. THE CHRISTIANS WITH THE CRUSADES AND SLAVERY WITH THE BLACK AND RED MAN WOMAN WHO WERE SUBJECTED TO 440 YEARS OF TORTURE WITH THE USE OF JESUS HOLY NAME AND THE CROSS. MUSLIMS WHO KILLED ALI AND OMAR IN THE HOLY MASJID! WE\'VE ALWAYS HAD MEN AND WOMAN MISREPRESENT GOD. THE JEWS AND JESUS. I WILL PRAY THAT WE ALL COME BACK TO THE DIVINE WAY OF GOD AND TO THE FOLD OF ISLAM, WITH THE GOSPEL AND THE LOVE OF CHRIST TO GIVE A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS WITHOUT COMPROMISE. YOU HAVE A CHOICE TO BE BETTER BY SEEKING KNOWLEDGE WISDOM AND UNDERSTANDING. MAY ALLAH AND CHRIST BE WITH YOU!\n\nTHE HOLY QURAN SAYS THE GREATEST AMONGST YOU ARE THOSE MOST MINDFUL OF HIS DUTY!THE WORDS OF OUR SAVIOR HAZRAT ISA IBN MARY(JESUS SON OF MARY) IN THE GOSPEL WAS LET THE GREATEST AMONGST YOU BE A SERVANT!THIS DETERMINES WHO IS BEST OF THE UMMAH AND THE TRUE BODY OF GOD AND CHRIST MUSLIM, CHRISTIAN HEBREW, JEW NOT YOUR TITLE YOUR ACTIONS.JESUS SAYS YOU KNOW MY FOLLOWERS BY THE LOVE THEY GIVE!OUR LORD AND SAVIOR ALAMIN NABI MUHAMMAD SAID WE PASS FROM DEATH TO LIFE WHEN WE LOVE THE BROTHER AND SISTERHOOD!\n\nThe book of mathew says that jesus is the seed of david acording to the flesh but declared to be the son of god according to the spirit of holiness! The bible says ye are all gods, children of the most high god! Elohims, el, sanhedrin, abd ilahs, abdullahs, KHALIFAHS are all children of the most high god. We call ALLAH god abba abott abi rabbi or master father teacher creator, these are the attribute of the parent of the righteous the sons (SUNS) of god (LIGHT OF GOD IN MAN AND WOMAN) not from his genitles but from his divinity, virtue, and holy practices.MUHAMMAD was this kind of man and so was JESUS THE CHRIST and the prophets. They are considered the children of god because they reflect the ways love and truth of their father god in their everyday life and shared it with humanity and mankind!\n\nLOVE!!!!!!!!!!! These three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love. GOD IS LOVE ( AL WADOUD) AGAPE, PHILOS, EROS!!!!! The words last words of our lord and Savior Jesus the Christ Hazrat Isa Ibn MARYAM; I sum the law up in these words; LOVE god with ALL your heart mind and soul, want for your brother what you want for yourself, do unto others as you would have others do unto you, LOVE YE ONE ANOTHER AS I HAVE LOVED YOU! How can you say you love god who you\'ve never seen and hate your muslim, christian, hebrew, jew, hindu, buddhist,shaman, asiatic, arabian, african, black, brown, red, yellow, and white brother and sister you see everyday!\nMuhammad\'s last words (PBUH) said we past from death into life when we love the brother and sister hood! I got a bowl of bean soup you got a bowl of bean soup!\n\nLOVE COVER A MULTITUDE OF SIN! CHARITY (LOVE) STARTS AT HOME! MAN OR WOMAN DON\"T TAKE OF HIS FAMILY IS AN INFIDEL! I LOVE MY LA FAMILIA, I LOVE YOU ALL WITH THE LOVE OF GOD AND WANT YOU TO BE PROSPEROUS IN THE RIGHT WAY! PEACE, POWER, AND, BLESSINGS ALWAY.\n\nI LOVE ALL HUMANITY AND MANKIND, THE PROBLEM OF THE WORLD IS NOT RACE OR BLACK AND WHITE. MUSLIM, HEBREW, CHRISTIAN, JEW OR BUDDHIST. THE PROBLEM OF THE WORLD AND WORLD PEACE IS, DISRESPECT AND RIGHT AND WRONG , LACK OF LOVE AND SERVICE.

On being asked what rule I had broken, he said that he saw me crossing the signal from the other side of the road. I responded saying that this is a normal practice, when the traffic light is green many other vehicles also follow the same route, a video of the same has been uploaded as a proof. Also there was no sign board prohibiting the same.\nEven if that would have been an offence, as per the common place traffic rules, only a spot fine of Rs.100 can be taken from the violater, but the sergeant name Mr. Bijoy Kumar Paul has forcefully taken my driver\'s licence. Not only this, his utter disregard for being just clearly shows in the video; when I asked why only I am being caught if it is an offence, & not the other cars following me. Then on numerous later rounds of the signal, there was a bureaucrat car with a blue light & several red light cars, who took the same route. On asking why those cars were not penalised, he responded saying that it was an emergency car. I was shocked at the height of discrimination, as we all clearly know that only ambulances, fire brigades,etc. are considered emergency vehicles. Also, I was told that only the first car will be penalised & not others. Secondly, he also oversmartly instrcted his subordinates not to allow cars to follow the same route so that i cant capture it in the video, but he couldnt succeed as it is a common practice followed by all on Gurusaday road. \nWhen I was not around, he forcefully pressurised my poor driver for his licence, which was his only ID proof available with him as he was going to travel to his village the next day. He begged to pay a spot fine in lieu of the licence, as he had no option. But being arrogant, egoistic, & rude, the sergeant did his unjust decision.\nIs this the injustice that the Kolkata traffic policemen are doing to harrass commoners by taking away their licence or charging fine only to the first offender? This shows that it is a practice of pocket filling by the policemen, who scare common people & take undue advantage from them, to falsely show their efficiency to their seniors.

If 30 seconds of such time is said to be penalised under this section then I probably would call for a clarification for the same.\nNext section charged is 119/177 MVA - \'Red Light Jumping\' then where on earth is Red Signal near La Martiniere school. If you mean to say AJC Bose Road to La Martiniere School then you must be knowing a single cycle cannot pass in Red Signal as always 2 to 3 traffic guards are there ALWAYS. Same is case from Rawdon Street to Shakespeare Sarani crossing.\nI am attaching mail to \'esttp.guard@kolkatatrafficpolice.gov.in\', \'dctp@kolkatatrafficpolice.gov.in, dctraffickol@gmail.com, dctp@kolkatapolice.gov.in\' sent in this regard in the comment.\nBut no email has been received or an acknowledgement as courtesy.\nPlease let me know do I need to pay for these false cited offences at Rawdon Street or I receive a confirmation of dismissal of these offences.\nRest I will pay as really I could not recollect and probably they are true.\nCan I get an answer please?', '2017-03-20T17:23:10+0000', 'positive'),

There the examiner kept my original  MCWG DL & the  learner license as well.I asked for an acknowledgement but he refused.He said that there is no such system of providing any acknowledgement to any body.As they did the same to every one,I also came back like the others.They asked me to go to the cash counter to pay the B.O.T. fees after 10 days from that day.I did the same.But there I found that they already lost my file & simply denied everything.Finally they forced me to appear the test once again and made me run to the court at least 5 days.\nMy question is -\n1. Is there actually no rule of providing acknowledgement after handing them over all original documents ?\n2. Soft copies of all documents related to my vehicle [ DL,R.C.Book,Tax Bill,Insurance paper,Pollution Paper] are acceptable to the traffic police check times or not ??\n{as mentioned in news soft copies are allowed http://eisamay.indiatimes.com/nation/soon-you-may-need-to-carry-just-a-soft-copy-of-licence/articleshow/53114563.cms   }\n\n\nLooking forward for your reply soon.\nRegards.', '2016-07-10T10:18:30+0000', 'positive'),

As we observe, the main culprits are OLD Buses (mostly govt buses) and Most Ambassadors, Auto driven by KATA-Tel and TRUCKS. Why the concerned Police dept does not catch them RED-HANDED? As because they are Govt. Property?\n\nIt is more dangerous than shooting a person by GUN. It is affecting all the CITIZENS and killing them silently.  \n\nThey are polluting our city enormously. We hardly doubt any of them has a VALID Pollution control paper which is holding value below tolerance limit.\n\nWe often see that if they are caught, they get released by giving penalty. But the problem does not get resolved. They Keep polluting AIR.\n\nIt is our City and We have the responsibility to keep it clean. \n\nPlease take hard step to compel them checking pollution regularly and generate a correct report (NOT MANIPULATED one).\n\nMost of our children suffer from Breathing problem, Lungs problem. It is thousand times harmful than a Car having >2 litre engine and having a modern pollution control system in it.\n\nWe have enormous FAITH on you Sir. And we believe you will surely take necessary action against this CRIME. \n\nPlease do not allow vehicle to move on road emitting bad AIR.\n\nElse, After some years we would hardly expect someone born in a normal condition. Thanks!', '2015-12-17T06:19:44+0000', 'negative'),

We are very old locals of our area Kidderpore.\nOur life has become miserable due to innumerable vehicle parking illegally in our lane and in spite of several complains there is no action taken by the local Police and other Authorities.\nThis parking is caused due to the illegal markets built up near Mansatala Lane all illegal contruction has been done I PLAZA, GREEN PLAZA 2 , M K PLAZA AND now a new contruction done upcoming market just beside my house 6.5 floors inside local lane named \"HongKong Trade Centre\" all these markets are illegal and i can guarantee kmc and other authorities has been bribed for all these illegal construction which has no parking facility and no proper construction. \nThere are \"No Parking\" Boards still  everyday there are several  vehicles kept in-front of our house,and creates a lot of Chaos not even an ambulance can pass due to the illegal parking both side of the lane. I there by bound to write a mail to you and other authorities without seeing any other way.\nWe are unsafe and therefore fear that anything can be kept in those vehicles which are kept illegally in the lanes. \nWhenever we call the Traffic Authorities they said  \"We will look in this matter\" however they fail to do so.\nIt\'s our earnest request please look into this matter seriously and take necessary action. \nRegards \nSaikat Dey', '2016-09-24T08:25:21+0000', 'negative'),

But today, the 27th of January 2017 was very different.\nI was waiting to take an U-Turn from the Corporation Garage stoppage (before Entally crossing) at around 10am. The traffic signal went green for me to take the turn and red for vehicles coming from Entally. I was taking the turn and just then, a public bus, violated the signal and screeched to halt at only an inch away from my car. \nI was totally shocked and looked at the uniformed traffic police guy standing there at the junction. Contrary to what I expected, he waved at the bus driver throwing a smile and gestured him to move on. He did not even note down the bus number. \nShocked by his reaction to the incident, I decided to walk up to this man in blue uniform and find out what stopped him from taking the bus driver to task. I asked him his name. He denied identity, but I later came to know from others that his name is Ashraf. My conversation with Ashraf follows:\n• Myself: Apni ekhane ki korte achen? (Why are you here?)\n• Ashraf: Ami ekhaner traffic police. (I am the traffic police here.)\n• Myself: Ki hoto jodi bus ta mere deeto amay? (What would have happened if I were hit?\n• Ashraf: Dile dito. Ami ki korbo. (if it were to happen, it would have happened, what can I do). \n• Myself: Merey dito toh amar baccha taar ki hoto? (what would have happened to my kid, if I was hit?) \n• Ashraf: Barite aaro onek lok aache nischoi dakhaar (There are people at home, I am sure, to look after your kid).\nSo, according to Ashraf, this man in uniform, it is okay to be hit if I have others to look after my kid at home. \nMy humble question to your department: If there were not anyone to look after someone\'s kid after he or she is hit, would it be written all over that person for traffic guys like Ashraf to take a traffic control decision? Is it not their duty first to make every vehicle compliant to traffic rules and penalize the ones that don\'t? In what capacity does a traffic police be lenient to \'specific\' vehicles and disrespectful to ordinary citizens who approach him?\nAlthough later I spoke to the sergeant on duty there and he assured action against Ashraf, I feel compelled to bring this matter to broader notice. I would like to see tangible action being taken against these kinds of men in uniform who are audacious, unlawful and arrogant. As an ordinary citizen, I do not know how these men are recruited into the traffic department, but I can at least appeal to you that teach them manners, if you can\'t teach them their duty.\nI would like to regain my faith in the Kolkata Traffic Police, and look forward to justice very soon.

I got my name transferred on 11th Aug 2014 in Barasat RTO. Now when I am trying to sell my car I am seeing there are close to 40 cases of Rs. 100 is appearing on the Kolkata traffic police website against my car.\n\n The issue is almost all of those incidents are before 2014. And there are only 2 cases during the period when I own the car.  The previous owner might have not paid those pending fees.  When I bought the car I checked but there were no cases appearing in the website. It seems that those have been updated later on. I got very much worried and paid those pending fees for which I got the payment option today.  Few cases with status \'court\'  are still pending (only two of those are during my ownership).  I tried to contact the previous owner, but unfortunately he  passed away. \n\nI have no other way but to seek your help in this situation. Would request you to kindly consider my issue and refund or waive off the pending fees for which I was not responsible if possible. I am attaching my smart card details here.

So the sms from KTP is indeed a bit shocker for me.\n\nAs intimated, tried multiple times to check and pay online for the pending cases at the site mentioned, but could not do so due to a pop up - “Invalid Chassis No\". Surprisingly buying a new car from an authorized Maruti dealer in Kolkata, and getting a pop up of “Invalid Chassis No” in Kolkata Traffic Police site when all the details provided accurately, is really a second shocker for me.\n\n However being a responsible and law abiding citizen, I personally visited Beliaghata Traffic Guard located at Chingrighata on 20.03.2017 and was being informed that I have 7 court cases pending against my car since 2015 and they showed me the details of the cases in places in Kolkata where I less frequently travel with my car.\n\nWith doubts in my mind but to expedite the matter, I agreed on paying the necessary fines and releasing the cases levied upon my car. But to my utmost disbelief, I have been informed that I have to shell Rs.500.00 / case ie. Rs.3500.00 for 7 court cases including the fine and court official fees to settle the matter (Rs.300.00 / case as fine & Rs.200.00 / case as court fees).The entire amount can be deposited at the Traffic Police Guard and the settlement would be done within two days.\n \nBeing one of the earliest member of your facebook page and a lucky attendee of the first interaction with the facebook friends at Lalbazar with the senior police officials way back in June 2012, I genuinely have immense respect for all the members of Kolkata Traffic Police and the work they are doing 24*7 to keep the city safe and sound but again with this recent experience I really feel cheated. My car being a self driven one, I can assure that I have never taken my car to some places listed in the pending cases nor I was a traffic violator. And I am not alone; thousands of such penalties are being levied against vehicles for no reasons and people have to cough up the money as fines just to avoid further harassment.\n\nThrough this communication, I would at least like you to educate me and thousands of sufferers like me out there on how to overcome this unwelcome situation .Would humbly request you to intimate us about the exact amount to be paid as fees for the court citation cases against one’s vehicle (Signal Violation and cases like that) and both the online and offline procedure for paying the fines at the earliest to avoid future complications.\n\nThanks and Regards\n\nSwarup Saha\n9831569933', '2017-03-22T08:25:08+0000', 'positive'),

Near the Laketown crossing where a U turn has been created to take a turn towards laketown, a bus plying on the route 215A took a U turn from the extreme left flank of the road to extreme right(have attached a picture  for reference). I was on the middle lane on my scooty near the rear wheels of the bus, the bus rammed my scooty, my scooty crashed down near the right  rear tyre of the bus & I suffered injuries. I would like to mention that the bus didn’t give any indication that it would take a right turn, no side indicator was put on neither he made a manual indication by waving his hand & all this time I kept on honking to make the bus driver realise that I was on the right of the bus & the bus turn would result in ramming into my scooty. I approached the traffic guard at the crossing who although witnessed the accident denied to lodge a complaint on the pretext that the vehicle has not sustained any damage . To quote him he said “vehicle has not been damaged so case can’t be lodged” although I have suffered injuries & I may have even lost my life because of this errant driver. The traffic guard was infact helping out the errant driver to flee away with the bus, he neither took a complaint , he even didn’t  take down the number of the bus, rather he kept on fighting with me that I need to move out my vehicle so that the bus is not held up . I was forced to dial 100 on which police sergeants from Bidhannagar police station came down & helped me to lodge a complaint at the Laketown police station. I am herein attaching the video footage of the traffic guard & also the bus details which rammed against my scooty.

Now there are no proper signage over there and on a vacant road what do you expect to drive at 40 kmph. Which he told was the max speed allowed. He took 300 Rs spot fine and gave me the reciept. \n\nWhat do you expect from us to remember different speed limits at different roads. Somewhere it’s 40 somewhere it’s 50 and somewhere it’s 60. Is it possible to remember the speed limits everywhere. And by driving at 40 on vacant roads the roads will become more jam. It’s not the solution. \n\nWhy don’t you all issue a uniform speed limit for entire kolkata. That will be easy for everybody to remember. \n\nFrom my side what I paid today was wrong.

Since we are very well aware that the entire stretch of road remains busy with school leaving children of various ages, our car speed limit always remained within 20 Kms / hour. \n\nHowever, we do apologize, while mentioning the fact that our car may have just nicked unintentionally at one of the mini-conical Blue-White Standees at the road which was placed in the middle of the road and was almost invisible, since it was raining and the road, as understandably, was crowded by parents & their home bound children.\n\nThe Officer on Duty along with his colleague immediately beckoned us to stop the car by the road side which, I did without any hesitation. \n\nTo our utter dismay the officer in question very rudely asked me to come out of the car & literally ordered me in a very harsh and threatening tone to put the conical standee back in place while constantly accusing me of a possibility of destroying a govt property.\n\nFirstly, we wish to bring to your kind notice that we did not, under any circumstance, destroy any govt property as alleged by the officer on duty. However, what we found very objectionable and demeaning was the tone and the way in which the officer was treating me & my wife.\n\nAny self-respecting citizen would have found the behaviour very rowdy & unworthy of a person wearing a Uniform that epitomize public safety. Hence, I refused to place back the standee while pleading him time & again that he could note down my car number and register a case if at all applicable. We being knowledgeable, educated & respectful citizens, found your officer treating us literally in a very servile manner and all the while threatening to lodge a case against us using the phrase like “EMON CASE DEBO, DEKHBEN !”.\n\nI find this attitude of your officer very vindictive and absolutely unworthy of his uniform. I have even made him aware during the conversation that all of these are getting recorded in his camcorder but he was quite dismissive about it. The worst part was that, he was treating my wife in an absolutely disrespectful manner. When I had demanded to know his name & speak to his senior, he refused to co-operate, turning a deaf ear to us. His Name-tag was not visible on his uniform, however we could catch a glimpse of his colleague’s name tag ending with “Mishra”. \n\nWe had also told him that our toddler son was waiting in the car, but he showed no humanity to our plight. We have very high opinion & respect regarding the functioning of Kolkata Traffic Police Department all along which we even told your officer unequivocally. \n\nHowever, today’s incident has lead us to raise few questions against the functioning of few officers like him of your department who are actually tarnishing the department’s image.\n\nWe, ourselves, could have easily recorded today’s incident. However, as responsible citizens, we refrained from doing so. We know that Kolkata Traffic Police has always extended their arms to help out the citizens, however the attitude of this particular officer was not of assistance, co-operation or understanding. Rather it was Harassing, Vindictive and severely insulting to a family who happen to be socially responsible.      \n\nWe would like to request your team to make an immediate inquiry into the matter so that such incidents do not make a recurrence & school returning parents are not unnecessarily harassed by Officers on Duty of the area. \n\nThank you. \nYours respectfully.', '2017-11-15T10:32:20+0000', 'negative'),

The stretch in question is Metropolitan Co-Operative Housing Bus Stop, between Chingrighata and Mathpukur. A Service road has been constructed shunting from E M Byepass just after Captain Bhery and joining back to the Byepass AFTER crossing the RED SIGNAL at Metropolitan. Recently a portion of the road has been cordoned off for metro construction. While we do understand that \"Today\'s Pain is Tomorrow\'s Gain\", passengers getting down from Science City bound traffic are having to cross the road precariously, without a STOP Signal to control traffic. Busses are dropping Passengers beyond the service road, and the commuters are having to cross the service road, as well as the bypass. Traffic in Byepass stops for a red light, but since there is no traffic control on the service road, elders and youngsters alike are having to run and jump between heavy traffic to cross. You know better than anyone else how beautifully respectful our drivers are towards pedestrians. It can easily lead to a major accident involving loss of lives... ANYTIME NOW!

The signal was green when the vehicle was crossing the stop line. The signal turned yellow just after the car crossed the stop line. The car was already in motion, beyond the stop line and was just in front of a traffic about to move from the road on the left of the crossing. If the driver stopped at that point which was definitely beyond the stop line, the car would have obstructed the path of incoming traffic from the left.

I was heading towards Anwar-shah from Tollygunge tram depot. While crossing the signal right in front of the Eastern railway ticketing counter the signal turned to AMBER from GREEN while I was 5-10 meters away from the demarcated stop line. I was maintaining a decent speed of 50 kmph and attempting to sudden brake and stop within the stop line might have proved to be fatal. The traffic constable on duty at the time, Mr. Karmakar, stopped my vehicle (WB06J9678) and even after politely explaining to him that the light had just turned amber when I crossed the stop line he went ahead and handed over a ticket to me as per MVA 119/177 which is basically jumping a red signal. I am uploading a footage from my dashcam as evidence and also attaching a copy of the Receipt. Unfortunately, it is only while taking a picture of the receipt I noticed and to my surprise he had written the date wrong. (14-12-2017 instead of 15-01-2018).

We took an Uber cab and unfortunately had to make several stops so changing destinations and stops were made with the consent of the driver. Suddenly after a stop the driver decided to take another booking and instead of dropping us off to the relevant destination started small talking with us. Eventually we got into an argument and the driver asked us to get off in the middle of the road. We not having agreed to this, he relentlessly drove us to a random Kolkatatrafickpolice booth and started yelling and howling claiming that we were drunk.It was around 11 in the evening so we did not want to get off the cab and were trying to book another cab while inside. The Kolkatatrafickpolice started blaming us and instead of helping us took us to the police station at Parkcircus where we were treated like offenders. I was called a loose woman for drinking (i.e with my own money at my friend\'s place), smoking and having an opinion. We were detained and my male friends were threatened of being put behind the bars and thus had to pay the officers some money. After which I was constantly harassed by the male police officers and there were no legitimate or uniform female officers, but some random women without badges. I tried calling my friends to resolve the issue, but my father had to come in with money i.e INR 2500 to bail us out, which was not done legally but was given to the driver outside the station. While almost everything happened in front of the CCTV camera the transaction was made to happen outside. While we were harried, the Uber driver was given great treatment for having got the three of us to the station. I was the only woman in the station for the longest time and was being continuously shouted on for my drinking and fun-loving nature. My question is to the state; are we forever going to be scapegoat to the despotism and power-play of the bureaucracy? Is it always going to be a struggle for normal citizens to travel home safely at night, without being harassed by cab drivers and state officials? Is it so difficult for people to have a good time without being blamed for it. I mean we all work hard for existence and recreation, with a 3rd world state as ours, the government has no specific aids/policies for unemployed adults! So how is it on the Government who allows F.L shops to do great business across the country have issues with a woman drinking? How does a tax paying citizen like me feel safe in this city? How can I move around freely without feeling threatened?\n\n#uberisuntrustworthy #midnightharassmentsbyKolkataPolice #uberdrivermisbehaves #iwanttolearnaboutmyrights #whataretherightsofataxpayingcitizen', '2018-01-16T05:59:04+0000', 'negative'),

As clearly seen, other vehicles also followed suit and violated the \"STOP\" line, presumably instigated by the violation by the Police vehicle.\n\nHowever, not paying much attention to it thereafter, on the green signal, I proceeded on my way.  This particular Police vehicle was travelling on the right lane near the triangle near the Open Air Theatre, while I was on the left, but in front of the said Police vehicle.  Suddenly, this vehicle\'s driver decided to swerve left, and hit my vehicle on the right side of the rear bumper, causing damage to my vehicle, as also his.  Not only that, this personnel, who was not in uniform, disembarked from his vehicle and ran towards my car, hitting it multiple times on the glass window and hurled abuses at me, despite he hitting my vehicle from behind.  Moreover, the person also tried to damage my driver side rear view mirror and tried to break the driver side window when I opened it half way to try to talk to him.  But since I was travelling with a patient, I thought it fit to avoid any altercation / confrontation with a person clearly intoxicated with power of position / uniform, and thus left the scene.\n\nI, however, informed about this incident to Police Control Room at 100 immediately, who advised me to lodge a formal complaint before Alipore Police Station, which I shall do forthwith. \n However, I request you to kindly take note of such incidents and sensitise Police personnel, as it really pains to see such actions / behaviour from law enforcement personnel themselves, who set examples to us commoners to always uphold / abide by the law.', '2018-01-27T17:20:27+0000', 'positive'),

('129115403803409_1495058497209086', 'I was travelling back to Kolkata from Odhisa dated 28/1/18 with my family and my friend’s family in his car. Near Ulberia around 7.00 pm a Mahindra Truck ramped our Indica Vista car from behind during a narrow juncture where all vehicles were slowly moving. We chased the truck and stooped it but the driver was denying his fault as we seek help from the CIVIC volunteers and called the traffic guard. The traffic guard took all papers related to both of our vehicles which the truck driver initially denied. Later we were made to halt in an open space and the driver was arguing and instead we had collided with the truck. He was even threatening of ramping our car deliberately and its consequences for which I restored. The Traffic guard and the Civic volunteers helped us a lot to resolve the issue by calling the owner of the truck.  But it seemed to me that the driver was denying the fact of his negligence which resulted to the damage of the body of our car. Lastly after almost half an hour the owner decided to pay a nominal price of Rs. 2000 for the demur rage and instructed his driver, although the driver gave us 1500 rupees. To me it seems that the driver was intoxicated with cannabis, and was very provocative. Finally we left the incident place and the papers were handed over to us by the Traffic guard. The truck had a Nagaland number NL 01L 7543 and the driver was screening influence of its owners. To me, I think such drivers along with its owners must be brought under scrutiny for repeating or avoiding any major incidents in future.', '2018-01-30T07:04:32+0000', 'negative'),

You will ask me \"What\'s so special about 5th of March\'18?\". Sir, in case you are not aware, the Class XII CBSE Board Exams started on 5th March\'18. It was around 9:15 a.m. Traffic was at a standstill on AJC Bose Road. We saw students alighting from cars and running to reach the nearby Exam Centres....almost in tears. No special efforts by the Kolkata Traffic Police to ensure that the children are reaching the venue in time and in a calm, unhurried frame of mind. If I remember correctly, when the Madhyamik and Uchha Madhyamik Exams are held, we see the KTP giving their best performance in controlling the Traffic. We have also seen that loudspeakers are banned by the Kolkata Police. Unfortunately, this is not the case for the non-Madhyamik children. A couple of days ago, late in the night, there were loud firecrackers being burst for a marriage. How do you expect the children to study ? We had to call the KP and complain. Are the children appearing for ICSE/CBSE not children of West Bengal ? Or is it that the state does not care for them ?

Vehicles are dangerously allowed to be parked not only on both sides of the road but also perpendicular to the kerb on one side leaving virtually no space for more than one car to pass. ON top of this, there is always a vehicle standing in double line on both sides waiting to be parked. Everyday we residents have to wade through this zig zag to get to our home. And imagine what happens when traffic becomes both sides after 10 pm. It is almost impossible to get home without putting up a fight for driving space. The drive of a mere 100 meters takes almost 10 minutes due to such illegal parking being operated by virtual touts under the nose of the police.\n\nLast Sunday only, I called up the South traffic guard  at 10.05 pm when my car did not get any space to pass in order to reach home from Camac Street end. The young sergeant who came to check and bring the touts to task did a very good job and even prosecuted vehicles. Even after his instructions, it continues to be the same scene everyday without any change.\n\nEven as early as 7 pm you can find vehicles parked both sides and in the manner explained above. It has become a nightmare to enter our street after 7 pm due to this issue.\n\nI urge you to take stern steps to stop vehicles being parked perpendicular to the curb and on both sides of the street. The revellers of Park Street have no right to disturb the peace of the residents and you must use your authority to help protect our right to peaceful living\n\nThanks and regards\n\nRajesh Jain', '2018-03-22T16:18:10+0000', 'negative'),

Also, I used to take pride of Kolkata Traffic Police (specially Sergeants) while I was working in other cities of India. \n\nLot have been changed recently as per my observation. Many Sergeants (with bunch of civic volunteers/constables) are targeting commercial vehicles to make money in a illegal way (read \"Bribe\"). Sergeants are randomly stopping commercial vehicles and finding ways to threat the driver for a high amount of traffic case. Since most of the commercial drivers are worried about their livelihood, they get scared and mostly never challenge  even they are at no fault. Then the bribe part starts. The assistants around the sergeant start making the deal. They often say in a way like - \"If authenticate case is given, you have to pay fine of 1200 rs. How about you pay 400/500/800 etc and get lost without any receipt\". EIntire amount goes to their pocket. \n\nIs doing legit business (through commercial vehicles) a offence ? \n\nPlease STOP \"Bribe\" practice and do not let down the prestige of Police department.

('129115403803409_1569554283092840', 'I have received a number of notices for violation of traffic lights over the past couple of months. Few I have paid fines to the police officer booking me for violation, few must have registered in the server for which I will have to pay fines eventually. As a law abiding regular citizen, I do not mind paying such fines but I have a feeling that over a past couple of months this fining for violations has gone into a revenue collection spree, where law enforcers are passing on all judgments to close circuit camera without considering the circumstances and conditions under which such bookings are made by your system.\n\nSir, my driving licence is roughly 18 years old so you can be reasonably assured that I am just not a tourist driving around in metropolitan city of Kolkata. May I draw your kind attention to busy traffic crossings of Kolkata, like say Gariahat or Rasbehari? Does traffic light mean much at such junctions where down lane vehicles continue to take turns directly across up lane cars under green signals? Does traffic light mean much when there is absolutely no pedestrian separation at such crossings where people jaywalk before the cars with impunity? Does it not seem that all violation laws are directed at vehicle owners?\n\nMy everyday experience is that the traffic light signalling in Kolkata is a sham, sir. On many ocassions, the lights turn red from green with a milisecond yellow in between and catch cars right at the crossing as offenders. In many places, traffic lights are not visible from behind tall buses, or are obscured by trees, and your officers continue to book and fine people who have no way to defend themselves. I am sure you know on many ocassions traffic constables give hand signals contradictory to light signals (signal showing red but police indicating to move). How fair and neutral do you think the system, sir? Is it fair to book a car driver just for the sake of a rule without judging his/her intent? Is that the way how a public servant discharges his duty?\n\nAs a citizen I welcome hiking the fines for traffic offences. But the other side of the coin should be strictly administeted streets with properly placed traffic lights and signals, clear and visible road marks, no parking or claming zone signs, pedestrian segregation from streets, and most importantly disallowing pandals, vending shops and other syructures encroaching the streets. If these are not done, it may appear that the traffic police are entrapping car owners and drivers in the maze of city roads and filling coffers of the state unjustly.\n\nThis said, I also do appreciate the risk, stress and toughness of the working conditions of traffic police in Kolkata.', '2018-04-20T08:21:47+0000', 'neutral'),

While travelling from Apollo Hospital (my work place) to Beliaghata (my home) through the service lane (parallel to em bypass), I was stopped by a Traffic Police at Kadapara/Hyatt end and I was informed that its one way ie, the lane can only be used while going from Kadapara towards Apollo Hospital.\n\nI did notice a guard rail at Kadapara end but no such thing or No Entry sign is there at Apollo/Mani Square end which is leading to great confusion.\n\nSince no clear cut no entry instruction is there at Apollo end of the service road, vehicles are taking that lane and going towards Kadapara only to find that the lane is indeed one way. \n\nIt is my ernest request to you to provide clear instruction and information of No Entrt at Apollo end so that we commuters are not misguided and the traffic flow remains smooth.\n\nThanks and regards,\n\nNilanjan Majumdar \n\nPS - The traffic police understood my confusion regarding the situation and was kind enough to let me go without any prosecution and I am thankful to him and Kolkata Traffic Police for that.  <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A>', '2018-04-21T09:38:40+0000', 'positive'),

I am here to bring to the notice the indifferent behavior of the traffic constables who are appointed in managing traffic at the crossing between Canal West Road & RG Kar road. I am taking this route every day since last 2.5 years and all this time I have been noticing some weird behavior of the cops at this particular crossing. They are absolutely indifferent towards their duty. Most of the time these cops are not present at the crossing but chatting away amongst them somewhere in the corner leaving the traffic on there own. Sometimes, they are goofing around with some truck/tempo drivers paying no attention to the traffic. They do not give proper signals to the traffic from either direction. Once I approached one of this constables regarding a confusion which resulted from improper hand signal by him which lead to an utter confusion in the traffic at this crossing. In return the constable was utterly rude in his behavior and started making insulting gestures towards me. Its my humble request to the higher authority that necessary action to be taken against these particular 3 constables who are appointed to manage traffic at the crossing of Canal W Road & RG kar road. If possible replace them with other personnel until some major accident happens due to the negligent behavior of these cops. I also have video footage of thess cops from my dash cam doing anything but not their duty if in case you need evidence.\n\nConcerned Citizen', '2018-04-21T11:24:43+0000', 'neutral'),

If I were to continue driving even after the signal went red,it could have caused a major accident or even if that could be averted,the traffic sergeants are always eager to penalise the civilians for any rule breaking. My point in writing such a post is two-fold:\n\na. Please review your traffic signalling system and make necessary modifications to the same,so as to avoid such accidents which can cause major damage to life and property of law-abiding tax-paying citizens.\n\nb.Who will bear the cost of the damage to the two cars, when neither one were at fault.This is a clear case of negligent traffic signalling system and thereby expect KTP to take necessary actions.\n\nThis post might never get published or any action might not even be taken,but going by the promptness shown by Kolkata Police on its FB page, I am still hoping against hope that this reaches the authorities and necessary actions and precautions be taken by the authorities, so as to not repeat such incidents in the future.\n\nRegards,\nSoumyadip Basu', '2018-04-22T08:50:09+0000', 'positive'),

There is a maze of roads from JL Sarani to New Alipore and I followed natural flow of traffic (read autos & commercial pickup tricks). I was stopped by this guy who told that I\'ve just entered a \'No Entry\' . I apologized and informed that I\'ve just bought a car and unfamiliar with this area. It never occurred to me that the road on which so many vehicles were plying is a NO ENTRY. There is no prominent No Entry board displayed.(In this age at least KP can afford a red light or display board or Notice board). The guy himself is positioned not to guide the traffic to intended way but to entrap unsuspecting citizens and extract bribe from them. He gave me 2 options i.e to settle the matter there & then by pay Rs. 100 to him in cash or he\'ll book me in serious offence. I said \"taking a wrong turn cannot be a serous offence. I\'ll just turn around and go my way. I\'ll not pay any btibe\". He didn\'t gave his name and rank despite several requests so I\'m not able to provide the same however his picture is attached herewith. To sum up I\'ve following complaints:-\n1. Please guide your force to regulate and guide the traffic rather than setting up traps for hapless citizens to fall into and pay you bribes. Kindly sensitize them towards public service rather than looting the public.\n2. Please look at his appearance. Unshaven, unclean, torn uniform, top buttons of shirt open. He looks more like a ruffian than a policeman. Your men need to learn to respect their job & position first before they learn public service.\n\nHope there is some improvement after this feedback.\n\nThanks.', '2017-05-24T04:15:50+0000', 'negative'),

I wanted to highlight & bring your attention about the lane discipline & traffic norms that must be observed on roads of every city. I have been driving in this city for more than a year now & I have hardly found anyone observing lane discipline. Private buses hover on the roads as if they own it, they stop anywhere and everywhere whether its the right most lane or on the signal line even if the lights are green to pick up passengers as if they are mimicking of a garbage truck to pick up garbage. The buses don\'t just reach the commuters to their destination but they also take part in a race with other buses to get more passengers & I have had many close calls & near misses just for these idiotic driving culture. The autorickshaws here are in so hurry & hungry for passengers that the side indicators are a mystery for them, they never bothers to indicate whether they are about to stop or make a lane change. In heavy traffic areas the 2 lane roads are automatically converted to 3-4 lanes by the magical powers of the drivers in the city making the flow completely clogged after the lights are green. Many trucks of that belongs to Kolkata municipality are way out of order to be driven on city roads, blowing out heavy smoke with rusted & broken chassis parts. Lastly I would like to admit that the vehicles or bikes that belongs to the Kolkata police are least bothered to take a halt on red lights. As per the rules only the emergency vehicles have the privilege to jump the lights that too if it is necessary and required. The buses violating the rules are never stopped for a challan or penalty because I have personally seen them giving tips to the sergeant incharge of a crossing. Well its a good way to earn though. Just wearing a helmet won\'t make the roads safe, lane discipline is mandatory too as the helmets and seatbelts. I had been driving on the roads of Mumbai since 2005 and the people driving there are just awesome. The traffic department in Mumbai has the courtesy to stop at red lights. As of my experience its a worst nightmare to drive in Kolkata. There are many possible ways to make the roads of Kolkata a much better and safe place to drive with very little contributions from the drivers as well as the traffic police. I\'m sure that this post is not going to change anything but still I thought to write, because we never know if 2-3% people of the city may start practising the actual campaign \"SAFE DRIVE SAVE LIFE\".', '2018-04-24T15:05:55+0000', 'positive'),
