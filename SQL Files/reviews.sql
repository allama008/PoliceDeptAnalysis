('2018-05-18', 1, 'Not so Happy Diwali !\n\nCouple of days back near Ram Mandir, on C.R. Avenue signal a 22 year old boy was crushed from behind by a speeding bus, just as he got down from another bus.\n\n\'Why is this important? This happens every where in the country, almost every hour of the day, 365 days a year. You are not making any sense. It\'s Diwali and we should wish lots of love, happiness and prosperity to everyone, rather than share negative stories. You are just an arm chair activist. Even worse you could be a comrade of a certain political party\'.\n\nI just want to spread awareness and draw attention of commoners like me, to the fact that our lives are in the hands of ill trained, indisciplined drivers, whose main aim is to maximize revenue of their buses/ or any other means of transportation. This could happen to you or your family member anytime of the day on any street in Kolkata. There is no concept of bus stop for these bus drivers, even we get down or board from anywhere and these buses will stop in the middle of the road for you. They compete against other buses from the same routes to get more passengers and drive rash. The driver ran away and will spend his life away from the city ,atleast for sometime till gets a new license under a fake name or some other job. But the boy\'s life...what about him? Is state government\'s compensation enough, if there was any? If this happened to your loved ones, will you accept it like a helpless aimless organism?\n\n\' You don\'t make sense at all. I don\'t know what you are cribbing about. Our traffic situation is perfectly fine and under control and we are not gods we can\'t foresee accidents. We can\'t keep a check on how every bus or taxi driver is trained. We certainly can not conduct surprise driving tests in adherence to all rules. We can not take away any person\'s license just because he is driving a bus full of 50 people and has their lives at risk by rash driving or not following rules. We fine them few hundred bucks for speeding and rash driving, that\'s more than 1 % of their daily income. They are poor people, they need money anyhow. We can\'t overhaul the corruption ridden practices of getting license by paying few thousand bucks and non existent driving tests to get driver\'s license \'\n\nHave you ever taken a bus here in Kolkata? Has some bus or truck ever injured or killed someone in your family? Did you not see any of those things I described?\n\n\' Ofcourse I know about all these things. But I think you don\'t make sense. Now get away from my brand new 4th Car, I have to go home and celebrate Diwali', '2017-12-15T22:33:00+0000', 5),

('2018-05-18', 77, 'Last Sunday(08/10/2017) morning around 10.30am in the morning I was driving through Rashbihari Avenue near Priya cinema. Beside Priya cinema there is a lane which is one-way. I mistakenly went to that lane in the oppossite direction. Immediately the near by officer in charge asked me to side my car and prosecuted me. I drove a mere 30-40 yards in opposite direction which was purely unintentional causing no damages. I requested the officer accepting my fault to minimize my penalty. He told that usually it should be Rs 2000 but as mine was unintentional he gave me a case of Rs 1000. While the officer was collecting the penalty, a rally of a political party was going. It constituted of 4-5 bikes and a car. The bikes were having 3 passengers and nobody were having helmet. The officer just asked them where they are heading and allowed them let go. After my formalities were completed I asked the officer why he allowed those people and prosecuted me. He told people participating in rallies could be exempted. I was totally shocked by his answer. Then I understood my actual fault- Violating one way is not my actual fault, my actual fault was I was not a part of any political rally. The officer even told me that if any judge would have violated the one way rules,he would have allowed him to let go. Again I realised my fault-it was not violating one way, it is not getting a judicial degree. Every thing should be recorded as the officer was having camera. I really appreciate the job Kolkata Traffic Police does each and every day for safe and sound travel. But this duality of character, rather duality of behavior, really shocked me. I understood my fault was being a normal civilian and not a cadre/member of any political party or not having any judicial degree. The officer in charge name (as displayed in name plate) was A L Hossain. The case number given to me AS1710084949. Moreover, we as civilian has every right to know the penalties for all kind of offences. All officers should have an authorized list of the penalties with them to increase the credibility and authenticity of Kolkata Traffic Police.

On 5th jul 17 at roughly 2130hrs i was returning home with parents and my 7 month pregnant wife. At ranikuthi signal i was waiting for the green signal to turn into NSC Bose rd. As the signal turned green i moved only to be stopped beside the island by a motor bike in the wrong lane right in front of my car and the signal changed while he moved. The police round the corner stopped me and asked me to park aside. I parked and asked him what was the offence. He informed me that the offence was of signal violation. I explained to him that this signal violation was circumstantial as the motor bike came in front of me in the wrong lane. To my utter shock he told me that its fine to enter a two way lane from the right side. I was wondering like is this man serious? How is that ever possible? Especially entering a two way lane with a statue dividing it at the mouth? When i argued my case and told him even we know the rules and if someone should be booked it was the motor cyclist. This exchanged turned heated especially after no understanding from the sergeant and my licence was seized wrongly under 3 freaking cases. One is of signal violation. The other i am givien to understand is of negligent driving. Third one i dont know. HOW ON EARTH CAN A MAN DRIVING HIS 7 MONTH PREGNANT WIFE BE NEGLIGENT? BLOODY HELL WE DRIVE SLOW OVER NUMEROUS POTHOLES TO AVOID DISCOMFORT TO OUR WIFE AND THIS MAN HAS THE AUDACITY TO BOOK ME FOR NEGLIGENT DRIVING.

For those events most of the cars are parked opposite to the road outside. This makes 2 cars driving in opposite direction a very risky task. Moreover if a big SUV comes from the opposite direction, it becomes very difficult for another car to pass. As a result, the road which usually takes 2 - 3 minutes to pass now takes 20-25 mins.

Have they taken any permission to use a lane of the road for parking as I believe road parking is not allowed there. Why is that no police personnel can been seen in the near vicinity.

I knew they were doing there job so I co-operated.

Mark the exact words of the conversation. \nOfficer-\"license ta din\". After a 9 and half hour shift my mistake was that I gave my license to him and said \"ei nao\". ? The officer screamed at me saying \"ki bollen? \" I replied \"ei nao\". And then started the harassment as if the whole day at an IT job was not enough. These people checked all my papers and when they couldn\'t find anything....they gave me lectures on why I should not use \"tumi\" and say \"apni\" to them. Like seriously? I am 23 and the person was mid aged.... I was polite and didnot misbehave at all. But these officer compared themselves with my office \"boss\". Wow. So much co-operation from KTP. In Bengali we use \"tumi\" to those we love and not to show any disrespect. I would like to apologize to all of KTP for telling your officer \"ei nao\". I have always had huge respect and gratitude towards you. I still have. I know there are officers who are genuinely good and work hard for our safety. But a huge part of my respect towards you got diminished today because of few of your members.

To the best of my knowledge of the law, if the signboard is not present, then it is not considered the citizen\'s fault. Also, the rules were not in place for the last 6 months because until May-2017, I am sure that the street was both ways.\n\nLater on, the policeman took a note of my vehicle number after saying \"aap log se tameez se baat karo toh aap humko sikhate h kanoon.

('2018-05-18', 284, 'I have been observing for last few years that erratic alleged traffic violation penalties are imposed in unfair manner specifically on the private car owners. In my opinion such alleged violations if at all found to be true are arising out of behavior of the indisciplined bus and minibus drivers including State bus drivers, auto Drivers, Taxi, cycle rickshaw, rickshaw vans, two wheelers etc. There have not been any major efforts made to organize seminars for each category of vehicle drivers to teach and guide how to behave while driving on Kolkata Roads. The Aadhar cards including other Identity details of all participants of such seminars need to be recorded for future needs. It is unfortunate that even after 70 years of Independence Kolkata has not ear marked separate roads for cyclists & other non motor operative vehicles. That is why we see Rickshaw Vans, Cycles and other slow moving vehicles ply on National and State Highways and the pedestrians are allowed to cross these Highways. The operators or the offenders of these segments are beyond teachings as their attitudinal disorder rule the roads. It is only in Kolkata among all metropolitan cities in India and/or among the major cities of the world that these indisciplined operators dictate the terms of movement of other vehicles which appear to be extremely unsafe & dangerous with possibilities of causing road accidents of very serious nature. Many must have observed how the young but rogue Taxi and Commercial Car Drivers drive in most dangerous manner completely ignoring the policemen posted at different crossings and creating dangerous threats for the decent car drivers and people. Under such prevailing circumstances we the educated and civilized private car owners-Drivers become the victims of the indisciplined and notorious behaviors of a particular section of vehicle drivers and for that Kolkata Police continue imposing penalties on civilized car drivers but not on the rogue drivers. It has now become a routine for the decent disciplined car drivers to receive every day at least one or two traffic prosecution notices from Kolkata traffic police and due to the same decent drivers become helpless and unfortunate victims.\n\nBasically the problem arises before the Signal Posts wherein bus or any other commercial vehicles will block the roads to stop the passenger cars following them from moving further and obviously at the cross line of the Signal post these operators will stop for a while to take passengers and/or for other vested interests and start moving only when the yellow signal is switched on. In the process the private car owners who were following the bus after seeing the green signal cross the stop line and the moment heavy vehicles in front start moving red light is switched on thereby unnecessarily and in an unfair way compel the private car owners get victimized with Stop Line violation penalties. During my last 50 years of ownership of cars and also of driving This is happening now since 3 - 4 years. Why are we not aggressively correcting the behavior of two wheelers, rickshaw owners, Taxis, Autos and buses and above all the pedestrians whose attitude and intentions need to be disciplined.\n\nWhile driving on erstwhile State Highways like VIP roads and EM Bypass my observations are even more pathetic. It is known all over the world that Highways are meant for fast driving without any obstacles created for the motorists to move speedily. But what we see in these State Highways (though Govt. of West Bengal has now de-notified some of the state High ways after Hon’ble Supreme court’s order to ban liquor shops near said Highways and Durgapur Expressway) that stop lines are drawn on the road much before the Signal posts are located. I have never seen stop line being drawn on Highways or Freeways anywhere in the world. By drawing such stop lines on such Roads, the character of Highways get changed to a busy thoroughfare in the heart of the city which these Highways are not so. For such reason the private vehicles or any other vehicles after crossing the stop line while the green signal is on certainly discover that green signal is converted into red signal directly by surpassing the yellow signal. On such situations Kolkata Police is now imposing penalties within half an hour time of such violations through SMSes. Is this fair and acceptable? Such unfair practices for imposing wrongful penalties must stop.\n\n\nFor last forty years the Administration has miserably failed to ensure that the Buses, Mini Buses and Commercial vehicles do not move in the middle of the road thereby blocking the traffic un-necessarily. Apart from Rickshaw and Vans the two wheelers are allowed to move Zig Zag way causing enormous threats to other vehicles on the road. Such behavior of the Motor Bikers also pose threats to causing serious accidents. Driving through the E M Bypass – Ruby More has now become horror these days. From Rash Behari Connector if a decent Driver wants take a right turn towards Metro Cash & Carry he will be encircled by dozens of commercial cars – Bus drivers to make ways for them even that causes unfair pushing the decent driver to the extreme right touching the guard rail. The problem is that the Turn Right signal keeps operative for only 30 seconds or so for which every vehicle wants to hurry up for crossing. Otherwise the vehicles will have to wait further for another five minutes. The moment the guard rails are touched A Sergeant appears on the scene who verifies all the documents of the car and the driver and even if the documents are found to be in order he imposes spot fine of Rs.100/-. Is this fair ? Is it not the responsibility of the Police to regulate the errant vehicles that cause damages to the interests of disciplined motorists.\n\n\nBesides above there are cases where penalties are imposed on the car which did not come out of the personal garage of the owners for more than one month or so on the dates of registering cases. Yet double penalties are being imposed with SMS notification to shift the matter before the court if not paid. These incidents no doubt question the ethical standard and the integrity of the Administration. It is high time that we design a civilized system of procedure to be followed for imposing traffic violation penalties. It is high time that we make efforts to change the irresponsible behavior and characters of the pedestrians who forcefully cross the Zebra line during the time when green signal is still on thereby compelling the vehicle owners to stop in between that leads to disruption of traffic causing accidents, continuation of uncivilized practice and unsafe traffic behavior. I personally feel that even if we have failed to discipline our pedestrians for last 70 years we should make a whole hearted effort to create awareness by imparting value based training to all the stake holders of Kolkata Roads. If it is done scientifically I am sure that we all will be able to build up a strong National Character that can be shown as example to others.\n\nFinally imposition of penalties for faults not of the certain vehicle owners but arising out of irresponsible indisciplined and rogue drivers mostly of commercial vehicles in its all categories need to be withdrawn for establishing the image of transparent administration.', '2017-04-23T19:37:00+0003', 1),
