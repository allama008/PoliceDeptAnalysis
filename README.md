# Study of Social Media Activity of Local Traffic Police Department: Their Posting Nature, Interaction and Reviews of the Public

In this project, we analyze the user engagement statistics, popular post types, trends in traffic updates of Kolkata, and extracting sentiments of the public. Our results provide practical useful insights for the users, as well as the community who are working on the policing frameworks. We have considered the official Facebook page maintained by Kolkata Traffic Police Department for analysis. The empirical study consists of 773 page owner posts and 595 visitors' posts, 301 reviews, and comments on page owner posts. This project will help the Police departments to leverage these online platforms to spread awareness, connect to the mass, know their concerns and opinions to use their potential accordingly for better satisfaction.
